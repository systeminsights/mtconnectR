Description: Read data in the 'MTConnect'<http://www.mtconnect.org/> standard.
    You can use the package to read data from historical 'MTConnect logs' along
    with the 'devices.xml' describing
    the device. The data is organised into a 'MTConnectDevice' S4 data structure
    and some convenience methods are also provided for basic read/view operations.
    The package also includes some functions for analysis of 'MTConnect' data. This includes
    functions to simulate data (primarily position data, feed rate and velocities) 
    based on the G code and visualisation functions to compare the actual and simulated data.
